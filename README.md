# TraceLabs Ether Scan
This application is a test by Aniefiok Friday, designed and implemented in fulfillment of career development at TraceLabs.
Ether Scan is a prototype search application that scans the Ethereum blockchain for transaction history and associated 
block data. 

## About Ether Scan
The application was built using web services of etherscan.io and 
[BlockCypher Ethereum API](https://www.blockcypher.com/dev/ethereum/#introduction). 
All wallet (address) query are performed on the etherscan.io. Data for block and transaction are retrieved using the 
BlockCypher API as this provides REST support for querying block and transaction information.
At the time of writing, the etherscan.io does not provide block and transaction information for both mainnet and testnet.
